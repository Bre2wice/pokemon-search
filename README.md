Pokémon Search 🐱‍👤

Hi! I really enjoyed this project assignment. This is my Pokémon Search project, built using vanilla JavaScript. 
You can type in a Pokémon’s name or ID, and it will show you its image, name, and type. 
I also gave it a fun Pokémon-inspired look with bright colors, gradient backgrounds, and a card-style display.
This project features include:

Searching for any Pokémon by name (like Pikachu) or ID (like 25).

Displays Pokémon Name, Pokémon Image, and Pokémon Type(s)

Handles errors when Pokémon doesn’t exist or the input is empty.


Fun Pokémon-themed styling includes ✨

Smooth yellow-to-blue gradient background

Red “Poké Ball” style search button

Rounded card display for each Pokémon

Colorful and easy-to-read interface
